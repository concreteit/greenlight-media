### Brought to you by Data4PT
The [Data4PT](https://data4pt-project.eu) project aims, among other objectives, to enable the interoperable exchange of travel and traffic data across the European Union. EU has already set the ground by requiring the development of the National Access Points (NAPs) by all MS. The next step is to ensure the information quality, accuracy, pertinence and harmonisation with EU standards, both on a national and regional level.
